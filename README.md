# Qubot - Feel the power...

## What is Qubot?

In quantum computing, a qubit (/ˈkjuːbɪt/) or quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum information. In [TradeWars 2002 (TW2002)](http://www.eisonline.com) **Qubot** simplies gameplay by automating common tasks such as colonizing, cashing, and much much more. By using the deaf feature of [TWXProxy Script (TS)](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Scripting-Reference), **Qubot** is able to give you enhanced displays and usefull information without tons of text flying by at high speed. Think of it as a quantum window you can use to play TradeWars without all that mucking around in hyperspace.

**Qubot** scripts are fully [Mombot](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Mombot-Reference) comaptable, and can be launched from within [Mombot](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Mombot-Reference). **Qubot** can also launch [Mombot](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Mombot-Reference) scripts and focuses on improving in areas not already covered by the public version of [Mombot](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Mombot-Reference).

**Qubot** is a FREE and [open source](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/Qubot/tree/master/Source) automatron written in [TWXProxy Script (TS)](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Scripting-Reference) and relased under the [MIT license](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/Qubot/blob/master/LICENSE).
